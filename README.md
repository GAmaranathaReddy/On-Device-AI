# What I learn in this course
As AI moves beyond the cloud, on-device inference is rapidly expanding to smartphones, IoT devices, robots, AR/VR headsets, and more. Billions of mobile and other edge devices are ready to run optimized AI models.

## Major concepts :

- Learn to deploy AI models on edge devices like smartphones, using their local compute power for faster and more secure inference.
- Explore model conversion by, converting your PyTorch/TensorFlow models for device compatibility, and quantize them to achieve performance gains while reducing model size.
- Learn about device integration, including runtime dependencies, and how GPU, NPU, and CPU compute unit utilization affect performance.

## This course equips you with key skills to deploy AI on device:

- Explore how deploying models on device reduces latency, enhances efficiency, and preserves privacy.
- Go through key concepts of on-device deployment such as neural network graph capture, on-device compilation, and hardware acceleration.
- Convert pretrained models from PyTorch and TensorFlow for on-device compatibility.
- Deploy a real-time image segmentation model on device with just a few lines of code.
- Test your model performance and validate numerical accuracy when deploying to on-device environments
- Quantize and make your model up to 4x faster and 4x smaller for higher on-device performance.
- See a demonstration of the steps for integrating the model into a functioning Android app.
- Learn from Krishna Sridhar, Senior Director of Engineering at Qualcomm, who has played a pivotal role in deploying over 1,000 models on devices and, with his team, has created the infrastructure used by over 100,000 applications.

By learning these techniques, youâ€™ll be positioned to develop and deploy AI to billions of devices and optimize your complex models to run efficiently on the edge.
